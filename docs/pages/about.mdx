# About

OpenLLM was started at [BentoML](https://bentoml.com) to provide a simple
and easy to use interface for serving and deploying large language models (LLMs)
in production. With OpenLLM, you can run inference with any open-source LLMs, deploy models to the
cloud or on-premises, and build powerful AI applications. It supports a wide range of open-source LLMs and
offers flexible APIs with first-class support for BentoML and LangChain.
